## General Information

**Objective:** Transform raw data into high-quality reports and dashboards for AdventureWorks Cycles, a fictional manufacturing company.

Stage 1: Connecting & Shaping Data
Focus on building automated workflows using Power Query to extract, transform, and load project data. Explore data connectors, storage modes, 
profiling tools, and table transformations.

Stage 2: Creating a Relational Data Model
Examine data modeling best practices, introducing cardinality, normalization, filter flow, and star schemas. 
Begin building the AdventureWorks data model from the ground up.

Stage 3: Adding Calculated Fields with DAX
Introduce data analysis expressions (DAX). Create calculated columns and measures, exploring row and filter context. 
Practice applying filter functions, iterators, and time intelligence.

Stage 4: Visualizing Data with Report
Bring data to life with reports and dashboards. Review data visualization best practices, build and format basic charts, 
and add interactivity with bookmarks, slicer panels, parameters, tooltips, and report navigation.
